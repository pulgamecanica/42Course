#### Try it: https://42-course.github.io/philosophers_visualizer/

---

You can execute your philo like this!
```bash
PHILO_ARGS="4 460 200 200 2" ruby -e 'args = ENV["PHILO_ARGS"].to_s.split; exec("./philo", *args)'
```

And then we can use this oneliner to open directly on the browser using my visualizer:

```bash
export PHILO_ARGS="8 1260 200 200 10"; \
\
xdg-open "https://42-course.github.io/philosophers_visualizer/?log_gz_b64=$(ruby -e 'args = ENV["PHILO_ARGS"].to_s.split; exec("./philo", *args)' | gzip -c | base64 -w0 | sed -e 's/+/%2B/g; s/\//%2F/g; s/=/%3D/g')" | bash 
```

You can take the example bellow to test it:

Welcome to a **cyberpunk-infused, pastel-powered, nerd-approved** visualization of the legendary **Dining Philosophers Problem**. This project takes logs from a philosophers simulation and brings them to life ‚Äî with motion, style, and lots of üç¥.

### üîç Features

- üéûÔ∏è **Millisecond-by-millisecond** animation
- üçù **Interactive timeline** with zoom, pan & scrub
- üåÄ **Circular simulation view** (drag, zoom, reset)
- üñçÔ∏è **Pastel color-coded actions** (to make it aesthetic)
- ‚úçÔ∏è Supports **log file upload** or copy-paste
- üß† Visualizes **fork states**, **philosopher actions**, and **deaths**
- üíæ **Auto-saves** last session with localStorage

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone or open the `index.html` in your browser (no server needed).
2. Paste or upload your philosopher log.
3. Watch them dine, think, sleep, and... sometimes die.
4. Use the scrubber, speed control, or jump buttons to navigate.
5. Zoom into a philosopher, drag around the table, or hit **üîÑ eeset** if you get lost in thought.

> Warning: staring too long may lead to philosophical existentialism.

## üñºÔ∏è Interface Overview

```

\| üß† Dining Philosophers |
\| üß™ Config Inputs       |
\| üìÑ Log Input           |

## üé® Philosophy of Style

- All philosophers are equal.  
- All forks are sacred.  
- All animations are smooth.  
- All colors are pastel.  
- All bugs are Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs bugs (they exist until observed).  

## üí° Contribution

Contributions welcome ‚Äî especially:

- ü™≤ Bug fixes
- ‚ú® UI enhancements
- üß© New view modes

Just fork, philosophize, and PR away!

## üôÖ License

This project has **no license** ‚Äî use it, tweak it, remix it.
