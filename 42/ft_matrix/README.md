# ft_matrix [Rust Implementation]

***

The project consists on developing a Vector and Matrix with several operations

***

### Generics

Both Matrix and Vector should support data type generics, for instance f64 or f32 as well as a complex number (for the bonus)

### Modules

The project is divided in 16 modules.

| # | Name | Example |
| - | ---- | ------- |
| 0 | Add, Sub & Scl | `v1 + v2`, `m1 - m2` & `v * 3.0` |
| 1 | Linear Combination | Providing a list of objects and an instance of the same object, compute all the combinations |
| 2 | Linear Interpolation | To compute the instance object defined between two objects (or beyond) |
