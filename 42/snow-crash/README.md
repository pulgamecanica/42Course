## ![Caesar Cipher](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-0-blue) Caesar Cipher

![Caesar Cipher](https://img.shields.io/badge/Caesar%20Cipher-ROT13-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=lock)

**Description:** In this introductory level, you will use a classic encryption technique known as the Caesar cipher. Specifically, you will decode a message that has been encrypted with a shift of 13, also known as ROT13. The flag is hidden in a file owned by the user `flag00`.

**Steps:**
1. **Find the File:**
   Use the following command to locate files owned by `flag00` and display their contents:
   ```sh
   find / -user flag00 -exec cat {} + 2>/dev/null | tail -n1
   ```
2. **Decode the Message:**
   Apply the ROT13 cipher to the retrieved content to uncover the flag.

**Interesting Fact:** The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his officials. Despite its simplicity, it laid the groundwork for modern cryptography.

![Password Cracking](https://img.shields.io/badge/Password%20Cracking-John%20the%20Ripper-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=key)

**Description:** This level introduces you to password cracking using John the Ripper, a popular open-source password security auditing tool. You will analyze the `/etc/passwd` file to find an encrypted flag.

**Steps:**
1. **Copy the Passwd File:**
   ```sh
   scp -P 4243 level01@127.0.0.1:/etc/passwd .
   ```
2. **Build and Run John the Ripper:**
   ```sh
   docker build --tag john .
   docker run john
   ```

**Interesting Fact:** John the Ripper is highly efficient and can crack passwords using various techniques, including dictionary attacks and brute force.

![PCAP Analysis](https://img.shields.io/badge/Network%20Analysis-PCAP-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=network)

**Description:** In this level, you will analyze a packet capture (PCAP) file to uncover hidden network requests and find the flag. This exercise will test your skills in network traffic analysis.

**Steps:**
1. **Analyze the PCAP File:**
   Use tools like Wireshark to follow the network traffic in the PCAP file.
2. **Identify Hidden Requests:**
   Decode any suspicious or hidden requests to extract the flag.

**Interesting Fact:** PCAP files are used to capture network traffic for analysis and are essential for network troubleshooting and forensic investigations.

## ![Echo Injection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-3-orange) Echo Injection

![Echo Injection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Command%20Injection-Echo-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=terminal)

**Description:** This level involves creating a custom `echo` command to display the flag by taking advantage of command precedence in the PATH environment variable.

**Steps:**
1. **Create a Custom Echo Script:**
   Create a script named `echo` that executes before the built-in `echo`.
2. **Modify the PATH Variable:**
   Change the `PATH` to prioritize your script over the default `echo`.
3. **Execute the Script:**
   Run your script to reveal the flag.

**Interesting Fact:** Command injection is a critical security flaw that occurs when an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on a host operating system via a vulnerable application.

## ![Perl Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-4-red) Perl Script Exploit

![Perl Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/Perl%20Exploit-Script-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=perl)

**Description:** Exploit a Perl script running on a specific port to extract the flag. This level tests your understanding of web vulnerabilities and Perl scripting.

**Steps:**
1. **Send a Crafted Request:**
   Use the following command to exploit the Perl script:
   ```sh
   curl localhost:4747?x=`getflag`
   ```

**Interesting Fact:** Perl is known for its text processing capabilities and is often used for web development, system administration, and network programming.

## ![Crontab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-5-purple) Crontab Flag

![Crontab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Scheduled%20Task-Crontab-purple?style=for-the-badge&logo=clock)

**Description:** Capture a flag generated by a cron job that runs every two minutes. This level highlights the importance of understanding and monitoring cron jobs.

**Steps:**
1. **Monitor the /tmp Directory:**
   Quickly access the flag file created by the cron job:
   ```sh
   cat /tmp/coucou.txt
   ```

**Interesting Fact:** Cron jobs are scheduled tasks in Unix-like operating systems that run automatically at specified intervals. They are commonly used for system maintenance and administration.

## ![PHP Exploit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-6-pink) PHP Exploit

![PHP Exploit](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP%20Exploit-preg_replace-pink?style=for-the-badge&logo=php)

**Description:** Exploit a vulnerability in a PHP script to execute commands and retrieve the flag. This level focuses on PHP security and the dangers of improper input handling.

**Steps:**
1. **Use preg_replace with \e Modifier:**
   Inject the following code to execute `getflag`:
   ```php
   [x ${(exec(getflag))} ]
   ```

**Interesting Fact:** PHP is widely used for web development, but improper use of functions like `preg_replace` can lead to severe security vulnerabilities.

## ![LOGNAME Injection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-7-lightblue) LOGNAME Injection

![LOGNAME Injection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Environment%20Variable-Injection-lightblue?style=for-the-badge&logo=variables)

**Description:** Inject commands through the `LOGNAME` environment variable to reveal the flag. This level teaches the importance of sanitizing environment variables.

**Steps:**
1. **Set the LOGNAME Variable:**
   ```sh
   export LOGNAME="lol; getflag"
   ```

**Interesting Fact:** Environment variable injection can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands, leading to potential security breaches.
