If we have something + nothing, we have something
its different than having someting + '\0'


The exploit relies on the last lines, we must evaluate to `else` in order to execute the system call

```c
if (strcmp(&var_98, argv[1]) != 0)
```

We want argv[1] to be equal to the var_98 which is read from 0x42. Then it's modified and they add the atoi value of argv[1]

```
*(&var_98 + atoi(argv[1])) = 0;
```

This seams impossible to evaluate to false... how could they possibly be the same? they are always different making the comparison != 0 true.

Unless both are empty! Both are zero! (not zero terminated)

So all you must do is to provide an empty argument.
