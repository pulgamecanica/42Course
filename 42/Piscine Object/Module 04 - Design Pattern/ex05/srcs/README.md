### Implementing Execute

### Course Finished

- EndCourse
Will graduate all the students and set the course as finished



Professors will get a new course if they can no longer teach (all lessons have been given) or if they don't have a course.

Professors will graduate students when the Course reaches it's end.

Professors will automatically be given a classroom if they can't find an empty one

Students will look for a course if they don't have any.
The student will request the director to give him a random course.

The random courses are gotten from the secretarial office, if the course was requested through the forms.
We could use Singletons but I dont wan't to mix up different patterns for now.
