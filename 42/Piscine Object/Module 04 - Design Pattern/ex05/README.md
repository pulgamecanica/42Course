### Facade

This is the last exercise, the facade will help put all the logic togeather.

We have a large set of classes now which work togeather. We have done tests on the main and we know there are some implications for some classes.

The school class helps integrate everything in a singular place, as long as all makes sense and it's connected.

This Facade is perfect to organize our logic! :D

#### Notes:

Decided to implement a School speaker to solve the "lunch lunch"
