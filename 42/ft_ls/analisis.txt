[Options One Per Line Format]

[DONE] -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
> Works simply 

[DONE] -A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
> Works simply

[N/A] --author               with -l, print the author of each file
> Not available with this format, no effect

[DONE] --color[=WHEN]         color the output WHEN; more info below
> Works simply

[DONE] -d, --directory            list directories themselves, not their contents
> Tested on: Regular Files, Links, Directories & checked colors

[DONE] -f                         list all entries in directory order
> Activates the all flag and sorting correct

[N/A] -g                         like -l, but do not list owner
> Not available with this format, will activate the long format

[N/A] -G, --no-group             in a long listing, don't print group names
> Not available with this format, no effect

[DONE] -i, --inode                print the index number of each file
> Works as expected, padding correct

[N/A] -n, --numeric-uid-gid      like -l, but list numeric user and group IDs
> Not available with this format, will activate the long format

[N/A] -o                         like -l, but do not list group information
> Not available with this format, will activate the long format

[DONE] -p, --indicator-style=slash append / indicator to directories
> Works as expected, appends a slash after the directories

[DONE] -r, --reverse              reverse order while sorting
> with default
>  Works as expected, the reverse is correct and the listing too compared vs original

> with time sorting
>  Works as expected, the reverse is correct and the listing too, compared vs original

> with no sorting 
>  Works as expected, the option reverse makes no difference, there is no sorting, compared vs original

> with extension sorting
>  Works as expected, the reverse is correct and the listing too compared vs the original

> with size sorting
>  Works as expected, the reverse is correct and the listing too compared vs the original

[DONE] -R, --recursive            list subdirectories recursively
> Works as expected, separations are correct, total is correct, no infinite loops found
